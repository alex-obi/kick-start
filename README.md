# kick-start

A collection of my solutions for some of the [Google Kick Start](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart) problems.
Some solutions are inspired by the Analysis tab provided by Google.
While most code files do work with the Sample inputs, there is no guarantee that they will provide a 100% accurate or time efficient solution.

## Run

One can use the bash scripts as

```
$ ./runcc.sh [FILE]
$ ./runpy.sh [FILE]
```
 
where `[FILE]` is the filename (without extension) to compile and/or execute C++ and Python files directly.
At runtime, the programs are fed with the entries defined in `[FILE]`.inp in the same directory.
